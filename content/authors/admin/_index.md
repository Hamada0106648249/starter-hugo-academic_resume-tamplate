Bioinformatika is specialized in providing all bioinformatics and modeling solutions including molecular dynamics (MD) simulations for researchers and pharma companies.
Our in silico methods (e.g., pharmacophore-based, structural-based virtual screening, and MD simulation) can help our valued customers in their computer-aided drug discovery projects starting from the identification of cryptic or allosteric binding sites in a given protein to the simulation of the drug binding process into its binding site.
Additionally, these advanced methods can provide our valued customers with crucial information about the time-dependent changes in a protein system, which can contain proteins, DNAs/RNAs, lipids, and other small ligands, allowing for the exploration of events of biological and pharmaceutical importance. Specifically, simulation can be performed to characterize protein flexibility, refine experimentally determined structures, evaluate protein-ligand binding, study biocatalysis or even monitor the protein folding process. 

B﻿ioinformatika is managed by Dr. Ahmed M. Sayed.
